**ROBLOX ACCESSORY SNIPER**

Instructions:
1. Set item ID of the accessory you want
2. edit time per request if you want
3. enter your webhook url
4. get your full roblox cookie (inspect element -> network -> refresh the page -> copy the cookie header on one of the requests to a Roblox API, then set the cookie variable to that header)
!!THIS WILL NOT STEAL ANY COOKIES!! proof read _everything_ before executing!!
5. start the script and it will start

make sure you have the discord_webhook dependency (open command prompt, then type in the command: pip install discord_webhook)

If you are getting 429 too many requests, your cookie is invalid
your cookie isnt going to last forever, to maximize duration grab an alt accounts cookie, then log out and leave it be.

THIS WORKS WITH BUNDLES AND ACCESSORIES BY ADJUSTING THE bundles VARIABLE, 0 = accessory, 1 = bundle
